# Backend / Python setup guide

## Version

We require Python 3.7. 

You should upgrade whenever you have the chance so that our project stays up-to-date. When doing so, you must update the Pipfile version, check that Heroku supports that version, that people already programming upgrade, and that the `install_guide.md` gets updated with instructions for downloading the correct version.
